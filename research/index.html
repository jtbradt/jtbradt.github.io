Policymakers often justify these programs as a means of stimulating infant industries, arguing that greater demand increases industry learning-by-doing, which in turn reduces costs for potential entrants. This requires learning spillovers between firms that make experience-based cost reductions a public good. However, spillovers can reduce firms' incentives to expand output and lower costs. To evaluate this tradeoff, I estimate a dynamic structural model of the market for solar panel installations in California that endogenizes firms’ entry and exit decisions and allows for learning-by-doing with knowledge spillovers. I find that a 1<span>%</span> increase in a firm’s cumulative production leads to a 0.7<span>%</span> reduction in installation-specific costs and that learning spills over across firms. Counterfactual analysis reveals that a state-level consumer subsidy program increased installer entry by 9<span>%</span>, indicating that industry cost reductions outweigh the decrease in firms' incentives to reduce costs by expanding output. While consumer subsidies may be effective at increasing industry size, I find that standard industrial policies such as entry subsidies provide greater welfare gains.</div> <p style="margin-bottom:0">Private Benefits from Public Investment in Climate Adaptation and Resilience (w/ Joseph E.

We estimate levees’ benefits by exploiting repeat residential property transactions. In areas protected by levees, home values increase 3-4 percent. Levees impose adverse spillover flood risks that reduce home values in nearby areas by 1-5 percent. Capitalized benefits in protected areas are progressive, but adverse spillover impacts are regressive. Capitalized benefits at levee construction do not vary by race, but racial sorting occurs post-construction. The local political economy of levee construction can explain the distribution of winners and losers.</div> <p style="margin-bottom:0">Complementarities and Optimal Targeting of Technology Subsidies (w/ Frank Pinter)</p> <div class="buttonbar">[ <button class="button" onclick='button("abs2")'>abstract</button> | <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/BradtPinter_SubsidiesAndComplementarities.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> | <a href="/assets/pdf/slides/bradt_pinter_iioc_2025.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a> ]</div> <div class="popup" id="abs2" style="display: none;">Policies often implicitly ignore potential interactions between related products. This is particularly true in the case of clean, energy-efficient technologies. We develop a theory of second-best policy for interacting clean technologies where first-best Pigouvian taxation of dirty substitutes is infeasible. Optimal second-best policy involves subsidies that are a function of cross-technology substitution patterns. Ignoring these interactions is welfare-reducing due to infra-marginal take-up of the subsidies and the optimal policy accounts for this by targeting the more price-responsive clean technology. We find evidence of complementarities between solar photovoltaics and plug-in electric vehicles in California, suggesting that policymakers should consider these interactions when setting policy in this context.</div> <p><strong><font size="4">Publications</font></strong></p> <ol reversed="" class="bracket"> <li> <p style="margin-bottom:0">Hotelling Meets Wright: Spatial Sorting and Measurement Error in Recreation Demand Models</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0; color:#666"><em>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, Forthcoming</em></p> <div class="buttonbar">[ <button class="button" onclick='button("abs5")'>abstract</button> | <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/Bradt_RecDemandEndogeneity.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> | <a href="https://github.com/jtbradt/recdmd_replication_package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a> ]</div> <div class="popup" id="abs5" style="display: none;">Conventional applications of recreation demand models likely suffer from two standard challenges with demand estimation, namely omitted variables bias and measurement error. Idiosyncratic prices in the form of individual-level travel costs can exacerbate these two challenges: the potential for non-random selection into travel costs through residential sorting and the difficulty of observing individual-level travel costs both work to bias traditional model estimates. I demonstrate the magnitude of this potential bias in conventional estimates of recreation demand models. I provide a relatively simple instrumental variables approach to address these two empirical challenges that substantially outperforms traditional estimates in numerical simulations. Replicating English et al., 2018, I find that accounting for potential selection into travel costs and measurement error through the instrumental variables approach decreases estimates of the welfare costs of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill by 12 percent.</div> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom:0">Voluntary Purchases and Adverse Selection in the Market for Flood Insurance (w/ Carolyn Kousky and Oliver Wing)</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0; color:#666"><em>Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 2021</em></p> <div class="buttonbar">[ <button class="button" onclick='button("abs4")'>abstract</button> | <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/bradt_kousky_wing_2021.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> | <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2021.102515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">html</a> | <a href="/assets/pdf/slides/Bradt_FSFworkshop_Feb21.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a> ]</div> <div class="popup" id="abs4" style="display: none;">Flood-related events are the most damaging natural hazard in the United States, yet many households at risk do not have flood insurance. Using detailed policy- and claims-level data from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), we conduct a holistic analysis of the market for publicly provided flood insurance in the U.S., focusing on not only high-risk areas subject to an incomplete mandate requiring the purchase of insurance, but also lower risk areas where no such mandate exists. We are able to better understand determinants of demand for insurance in a setting with voluntary purchase and low take-up and therefore provide a more complete analysis of the market for flood insurance in the U.S. than previous work. In addition to exploring correlates of demand for flood insurance, this paper provides quasi-experimental estimates of households’ willingness-to-pay for flood insurance and finds strong evidence to suggest the NFIP failing to utilize full information on flood risk leads to adverse selection in the program.</div> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom:0">Analysis of Proposed 20-year Mineral Leasing Withdrawal in Superior National Forest (w/ James H.

It also contains deposits of copper, nickel, and trace metals, and copper-nickel mining has been proposed adjacent to and upstream of the BWCAW. In 2017, the US Department of Agriculture proposed withdrawing land in the Rainy River Watershed within the Superior National Forest from mineral leasing, a position it reversed in 2018. These developments highlight the potential tradeoff between economic benefits from mining and concerns about its negative economic consequences for the local recreational and amenity-based economy. Previous studies of mining in the Superior National Forest focus on static effects on a single industry (e.g., mining) at some unspecified point over a medium-run horizon. We draw on these studies and the economics literature to provide a unified analysis of the effect of the proposed mining development on income and employment over time. Our results suggest that the proposed mining would lead to a boom-bust cycle that is typical of resource extraction economies, exacerbated by the likely negative effect on the recreation industry.</div> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom:0">'Underwaterwriting:' From Theory to Empiricism in Regional Mortgage Markets in the US (w/ Jesse M.

Underwaterwriting suggests that the unevenness of scientific knowledge and local soft information, as well as the institutional barriers for the utilization of that information, could result in determinations of risk that may not accurately reflect long-term asset performance or credit loss. These informational asymmetries may result in assignments of risk that reflect a degree of arbitrariness or inaccuracy that may operate to strand assets and shed or increase market share in ways that are inefficient and may otherwise lead to negative public externalities. Consistent with this theory, this article provides evidence that concentrated local lenders are transferring risk in high-risk coastal geographies in the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (U.S.) through increased securitization of mortgages. These findings provide an impetus for supporting more robust analysis of climate-risk in light of forthcoming accounting rules that require an upfront accounting of forward-looking credit losses.</div> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom:0">Comparing the Effects of Behaviorally Informed Interventions on Flood Insurance Demand: An Experimental Analysis of 'Boosts' and 'Nudges'</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0; color:#666"><em>Behavioural Public Policy, 2019</em></p> <div class="buttonbar">[ <button class="button" onclick='button("abs1")'>abstract</button> | <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/bradt_bpp_2019.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> | <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/bpp.2019.31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">html</a> | <a href="https://github.com/jtbradt/flood-insurance-bpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a> | coverage: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0654-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nature Climate Change</a> ]</div> <div class="popup" id="abs1" style="display: none;">This paper compares the effects of two types of behaviorally informed policy – nudges and boosts – that are designed to increase consumer demand for insurance against low-probability, high-consequence events. Using previous findings in the behavioral sciences literature, this paper constructs and implements two nudges (an ‘informational’ and an ‘affective’ nudge) and a statistical numeracy boost and then elicits individual risk beliefs and demand for flood insurance using a contingent valuation survey of 331 participants recruited from an online labor pool. Using a two-limit Tobit model to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for flood insurance, this paper finds that the affective and informational nudges result in increases in WTP for flood insurance of roughly <span>$</span>21/month and <span>$</span>11/month relative to the boost, respectively. Taken together, the findings of this paper suggest that nudges are the more effective behaviorally informed policy in this setting, particularly when the nudge design targets the affect and availability heuristics; however, additional research is necessary to establish sufficient conditions for this conclusion.</div> </li> </ol> <p><strong><font size="4">Work in progress</font></strong></p> <p style="margin-bottom:0">Clearing the Air: The Welfare Effects of the Clean Air Act’s Regional Haze Rule</p> <div class="buttonbar">[ <button class="button" onclick='button("desc1")'>summary</button> ]</div> <div class="popup" id="desc1" style="display: none;">The US Environmental Protection Agency promulgated the Regional Haze Rule under Section 169A of the Clean Air Act in 1999 to decrease haze and protect visibility in national parks and wilderness areas.
