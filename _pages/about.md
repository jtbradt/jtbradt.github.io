My research applies insights and methods from industrial organization and public economics to the study of environmental, energy, and climate policy.  In my job market paper, I study the effect of consumer subsidies on market structure in the U.S. residential solar industry.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Council on Environmental Quality and provided support on land conservation policy to various federal agencies for Booz Allen Hamilton. I graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in Environmental Science and Public Policy and a Secondary in Economics.

I will be on the job market during AY 2023-2024.
