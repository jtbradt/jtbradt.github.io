I am a PhD student in Public Policy at Harvard University. My research applies insights and methods from industrial organization and public economics to the study of environmental, energy, and climate-related issues.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Council on Environmental Quality and provided support on land conservation policy to various federal agencies for Booz Allen Hamilton. I graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in Environmental Science and Public Policy and a Secondary in Economics.
