I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at Harvard University. My research applies insights and methods from industrial organization and public economics to the study of environmental, energy, and climate policy.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Council on Environmental Quality and provided support on land conservation policy to various federal agencies for Booz Allen Hamilton. I graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in Environmental Science and Public Policy and a Secondary in Economics.
