Can subsidies to consumers be effective industrial policy?

This question is important for active policy debates in a number of areas --- perhaps no more so than in efforts to decarbonize the US economy, where supporting the adoption of early-stage, clean technologies through demand subsidies has become a popular  intervention.

Much of the debate surrounding these interventions highlights the potential for industry growth, a goal more often associated with conventional industrial policies such as entry or production subsidies.   Proponents of consumer subsidies on these ground argue that greater demand increases industry learning-by-doing, which in turn reduces costs for potential entrants. 

However, economic theory emphasizes that learning spillovers make experience-based cost reductions a public good, which reduces firms' incentives to expand output and lower costs.  The net effect of consumer subsidies on growth and entry in target industries therefore depends on the extent to which the public good nature of learning reduces incentives to lower costs.

I examine this tradeoff in a policy-relevant setting: consumer subsidies in the market for solar photovoltaics (PV).
