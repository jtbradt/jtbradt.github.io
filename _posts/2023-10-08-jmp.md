How should policymakers address climate change?

While economists have long advocated for carbon pricing, policymakers increasingly turn to second-best climate policies.  For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated \$37 billion for subsidies to consumers to adopt clean technologies.

Policymakers often justify these types of programs as a means of stimulating infant industries, arguing that greater demand increases industry learning-by-doing, which in turn reduces costs for potential entrants. 

But can consumer subsidies encourage firms to enter infant industries? 

In theory, public subsidies to consumers can enable industry cost reductions in new technologies; however, learning spillovers make experience-based cost reductions a public good, which reduces firms' incentives to expand output and lower costs.

I examine this tradeoff in a policy-relevant setting: consumer subsidies in the market for solar photovoltaics (PV).
