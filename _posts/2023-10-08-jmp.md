Are subsidies to consumers effective industrial policy?

This question is important for several active policy debates --- perhaps no more so than in efforts to decarbonize the US economy, where supporting the adoption of early-stage, clean technologies through demand subsidies has become increasingly popular.

Much of the debate surrounding these interventions highlights the potential for industry growth, a goal more often associated with conventional industrial policies such as entry or production subsidies.   Proponents of consumer subsidies on these grounds argue that greater demand increases industry learning-by-doing, which in turn reduces costs for potential entrants. 

However, economic theory emphasizes that learning spillovers make experience-based cost reductions a public good, which reduces firms' incentives to expand output and lower costs.  The net effect of consumer subsidies on growth in target industries therefore depends on the extent to which the public good nature of learning reduces incentives to lower costs.

To answer this question, we need estimates of firms' learning curves and a model of how firms make entry, exit, and output decisions.

I examine this tradeoff in a policy-relevant setting: consumer subsidies for solar photovoltaics (PV).  I study the impact of consumer rebates for solar adoption on solar installation firms, which account for a growing share of the final cost to consumers in this industry. 

I focus on the market for residential solar PV in California, which is home to half of all US residential solar PV systems and has extensive experience subsidizing household adoption of solar.  The California Solar Initiative, which ran from 2007 to 2013, provided \$2.2 billion in direct cash rebates to households that adopted solar PV.

Using data on over 50,000 residential solar systems in California for 2008-2013, I develop and estimate a dynamic structural model of the market for solar installations.  The model allows me to recover solar installers' learning curves --- including the extent to which knowledge spills over across firms --- and simulate firm behavior under counterfactual policies. 

I find that solar installers' costs decline dramatically with the quantity of cumulative production --- i.e., "experience."  On average, installer-specific costs dropped \$1.70 per watt of installed PV capacity over 2008-2013 in California, a 68% reduction.

How much of these estimated industry-wide cost reductions is driven by firms learning on their own versus benefitting from the knowledge of others?

While on the margin firms' own experience contributes more to their learning, the vast majority of observed cost reductions come from knowledge spillovers across firms.

I test several models of firm spillovers, including constant spillovers, spillovers that differ based on whether rival firms are in the same county, and spillovers that differ based on whether rival firms install the same type of panel.  Across all models, cost reductions from rivals' learning far outweigh those from a firm's own learning.

What role do these large knowledge spillovers play in determining the impact of consumer subsidies in this industry?
